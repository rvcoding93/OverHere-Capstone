Example: Katya has been separated from her 13 year old sister when her city was attacked. Weeks have passed and both are now safe but Katya ended up in Germany, her sister Ana ended up in Poland. Katya wishes to find her sister, she submits her contact information along with a photo of her sister and a photo of herself. Since Ana has not yet submitted any information, there is no ping/response. A few days later Ana hears about "Over Here" and submits her information as well. Since Katya had previously submitted all the required information, when Ana submitted hers a potential 87% match was registered. Both Katya and Ana recieve a notification to confirm the photo each of them submitted is in fact the same person. Once Ana and Katya have both confirmed YES this is the person I am looking for, the contact and location data may be authorized to exchange between users. 

If for some reason a user declines and says this is not a match but the other user confirms, a second photo may be requested to verify should the user feel certain this is the person they are looking for however NO contact information shall be shared prior to consent by both parties.
